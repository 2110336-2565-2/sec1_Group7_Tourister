# Getting Started

**_Make sure you are in this directory aka 'frontend'_**

1. install packages

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

2. start the server in development mode by running the following command

```
npm run dev
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will start the server and will automatically restart server with every js file changes

3. you can add new page.tsx in '/app/newpagename' folder directory. and then access it via 'http://localhost:3000/newpagename'

Note: if you need to have client components, you need to have `"use client";` at the start of the file
