# Getting Started

***Make sure you are in this directory aka 'webservice'***

1. install packages
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```

2. create your own environment by creating .env file with content like in .env.template
   - (which .env.template as of now is empty, so nothing to worry)

3. start the server in development mode by running the following command
```
npm run dev
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will start the server and will automatically restart server with every js file changes
